# Beesax-Programming-Assignment
Write a function that takes a string and returns the index of the first brace that breaks its balance (or returns the special value -1 if the string is balanced.)

# Background:

A balanced pair of braces is one open brace ("{") followed by one close brace("}") with zero or morebalanced pairs 
of braces between them.

 A string is said to be "balanced" if it consists of zero or more balance pairs of braces. A balanced string can also contain other arbittray charactes (Which are not relevant to its "balanced" property).
 
 # Assignment
 
 Write a function that takes a string and returns the index of the first brace that breaks its balance
 (or returns the special value of -1 if the string is balanced). The first brace that breaks the balance is the
 brace closet to the start of the string that isn't part of the balanced pair.
 
 Please state any additional assumptions you make and try to make your function as efficient as you can.
 
 For Extra credit write a unit test!!
